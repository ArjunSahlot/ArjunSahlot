# How to run my pygame projects

I have a lot of projects in which I have used a python library called [pygame](https://pygame.org). I am putting all of the instructions here instead of in each of my repositories.

## Steps

**PREREQUISITES:**

-   [Python](https://python.org) installed
-   [Pygame](https://pygame.org) installed
    -   `pip install pygame` should work for most people
-   Access to terminal

<br />

1. Clone the repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/ArjunSahlot/[REPO].git`
    - If you don't have git installed, you could download zip and unzip
2. `cd` into that directory
    - `cd [REPO]`
3. Install dependencies
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main file
    - In most cases it should be the `main.py` file
        - `python main.py`
    - In other cases it could be named `game.py` or some other relevant name

These steps should work for most of my projects if all the steps are followed properly and there are no errors. Enjoy!
